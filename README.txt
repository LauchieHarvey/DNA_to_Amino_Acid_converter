# DNA_to_Amino_Acid_converter
This is a simple command line tool that takes DNA sequence as input and converts it to amino acid codons.
It is currently working but still incomplete, the results are printed into a `.txt` file instead of the command line.
The final amino acid sequence is being saved in a `.txt` file. The logic for
converting to the amino acid sequence is rudimentary nested if statements, this is only temporary.
The `./gen` file can be executed in command line with one argument being the number of nucleotides (sequence length)
Enter the length after the file name as such: `./gen x` where x is the length of the sequence generated.

Any suggestions? Let me know! I'd love to hear.
